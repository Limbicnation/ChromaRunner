feat(core): Implement memory and NPC interaction systems

- Add MemoryEchoSystem component for recording and playing back memories
- Add NPCInteractionManager component for handling NPC relationships
- Integrate both systems into RunnerCharacter for seamless gameplay
- Add Blueprint-accessible functions for memory recording and NPC interaction

The memory system allows recording and playback of player actions, while 
the NPC system manages relationships and dialogue history. Both systems 
are integrated as components in the RunnerCharacter class to maintain 
compatibility with existing side-running mechanics.
