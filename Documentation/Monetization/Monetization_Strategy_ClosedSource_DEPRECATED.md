# ChromaRunner - Monetization & Release Strategy

**Document Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-11-15
**Status**: Approved Strategy
**Decision**: **Premium Model ($4.99) on Steam**

---

## Executive Summary

### Final Recommendation

**Business Model**: Premium purchase with Early Access launch
**Platform Priority**: Steam (primary) → itch.io → Mobile (conditional)
**Price Point**: $4.99 USD (full release), $3.99 USD (Early Access)
**Target Revenue**: $20,000 - $35,000 net (Year 1, conservative)
**Timeline**: 3-6 months to Early Access launch

### Why Premium Over F2P?

✅ **Genre Fit**: Skill-based platformers thrive as premium on PC (Celeste, Spelunky, Dead Cells)
✅ **Developer Fit**: Solo/small team cannot sustain F2P live-ops burden
✅ **Ethical Alignment**: No compromise to core gameplay, player-first design
✅ **Market Validation**: Similar games (Alto's Adventure $4.99, Geometry Dash $1.99) succeeded premium
✅ **Financial Viability**: Low breakeven (300-1,650 copies), realistic projections
✅ **Platform Strength**: Steam indie ecosystem supports quality game discovery

## Ethical Monetization Design

### What to Sell (Premium Game + Ethical DLC)

**Base Game** ($4.99):
- Complete experience, no content locked
- All core mechanics accessible
- Win condition achievable without purchases

**Cosmetic DLC** (Optional, $1.99-$2.99):
- Character skin packs (seasonal themes, community designs)
- Visual effect packs (coin trails, jump particles)
- Background theme variations
- **Zero gameplay impact** - purely visual expression

**Content Expansion** (Optional, $2.99-$4.99):
- New biomes (Desert, Underwater, Space)
- Challenge modes (Speed Run, No Damage, Coin Rush)
- Additional character with unique movement
- **Extends gameplay**, not essential to core experience

**Soundtrack DLC** ($1.99):
- Digital album of game music
- Support-the-dev pricing model

### What to AVOID (Dark Patterns)

❌ **Energy Systems**: Time-gating gameplay
❌ **Pay-to-Win**: Purchasable power-ups, extra lives, invincibility
❌ **Loot Boxes**: Randomized rewards (gambling mechanics)
❌ **Premium Currencies**: Confusing exchange rates ($9.99 for 1,200 gems)
❌ **FOMO Pressure**: Limited-time exclusives that never return
❌ **Misleading Ads**: "Free to play" with aggressive monetization
❌ **Aggressive Ads**: Interrupting gameplay (mobile F2P staple)

**Design Principle**: If it manipulates player psychology or creates frustration to drive purchases, don't do it.

---

## Player Retention Systems

### Core Retention Loop (No Monetization Hooks)

**1. Leaderboards** (Global + Friends):
- Daily, Weekly, All-Time categories
- Filters: Distance, Coins, No-Damage Runs
- Steam API integration for friends lists

**2. Achievement System** (30-50 achievements):
- Skill-based: "Reach 2,500m without damage"
- Collection: "Collect 10,000 coins total"
- Discovery: "Find all secret areas"
- Mastery: "Complete all biomes"
- Meta: "Die 100 times" (humor, reduce frustration)

**3. Challenge Modes** (Unlockable):
- Speed Run Mode (timer displayed, leaderboard)
- Coin Rush Mode (2x spawns, score attack)
- Hardcore Mode (one life, permadeath)
- Daily Challenge (fixed seed, 24-hour leaderboard)

**4. Progression Unlocks** (Cosmetic Only):
- Character skins via achievements (no purchase required)
- Color palettes (milestone unlocks)
- Trail effects (distance milestones: 10K, 25K, 50K meters)

**5. Statistics Tracking**:
- Total distance traveled
- Total coins collected
- Total deaths (per obstacle type)
- Best run stats
- Play time tracker

## Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### Major Risks

**Risk 1: Low Sales (<500 copies Month 1)**

**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: High
**Mitigation**:
1. Immediate (Week 1): Deep discount 50% off ($2.49), Reddit giveaway (100 keys)
2. Short-term (Month 2-3): Add to itch.io PWYW, Humble Bundle submission
3. Long-term (Month 4+): Pivot messaging (speedrun angle), consider F2P as last resort

**Risk 2: Negative Reviews (<70% Positive)**

**Likelihood**: Low
**Impact**: High
**Mitigation**:
1. Immediate: Public acknowledgment, hotfix critical bugs (24-48 hours)
2. Short-term: Community-requested features, difficulty rebalance
3. Long-term: Rebuild trust via consistent updates, convert critics to advocates

**Risk 3: Market Saturation (Competitor Launches)**

**Likelihood**: High
**Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
1. Differentiation: Emphasize unique mechanics, art style, speedrun focus
2. Timing adjustment: Delay 1-2 months if direct competitor launches same week
3. Collaboration: Cross-promotion with competitors (indie solidarity)

**Risk 4: Developer Burnout**

**Likelihood**: Medium
**Impact**: Very High
**Mitigation**:
1. Scope control: Ship 80% of vision, DLC the rest
2. Community energy: Positive feedback sustains motivation
3. Financial runway: Don't quit day job until $20K+ net revenue
4. Exit strategy: Define "done" clearly (1.0 = completion, no obligation for Year 2)
