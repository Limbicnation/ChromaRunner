## 🎮 About

ChromaRunner is an **open-source** skill-based platformer where precision, timing, and split-second reactions determine survival. Sprint through procedurally generated levels, dodge deadly obstacles, collect coins, and compete for global high scores.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Procedural level generation with 5+ biomes
- ✅ Tight platforming controls (run, jump, double-jump)
- ✅ Lives system with game over flow
- ✅ Health bar and damage system
- ✅ Coin collection and scoring
- ✅ Steam achievements and leaderboards *(Steam version)*
- ✅ Full C++ source code available for learning

---

## 🎓 Project Origins

ChromaRunner started as a learning project following the excellent [**Endless Runner tutorial by AwesomeTuts**](https://awesometuts.com/blog/unreal-engine-cpp-tutorial-endless-runner-game/). Over 12+ months of development, the codebase was **completely rewritten and expanded** with:

- Custom health system with PlayerHealthComponent
- Lives management via SideRunnerGameInstance
- UMG C++ widget system (HUD, Game Over screens)
- Procedural level generation with BaseLevel system
- Coin collection and scoring mechanics
- Game mode orchestration with ASideRunnerGameMode
- Console debug commands for rapid testing

**What remains from the tutorial:** The core "endless runner" concept and initial character movement foundation.

**What's custom:** 95% of the codebase, all systems architecture, UMG integration, game flow, and procedural generation.

**Credit:** Special thanks to [AwesomeTuts](https://awesometuts.com/) for the foundational tutorial that made this project possible.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Unreal Engine 5.5** ([Download here](https://www.unrealengine.com/download))
- **Visual Studio 2022** (Windows) or **Clang 15+** (Linux/Mac)
- **Git** for cloning the repository
- **8GB+ RAM** (16GB recommended)

### Clone and Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]/ChromaRunner.git
cd ChromaRunner

# Option 1: Build via Makefile (Linux/Mac)
make SideRunnerEditor

# Option 2: Build via Visual Studio (Windows)
# 1. Right-click SideRunner.uproject → "Generate Visual Studio project files"
# 2. Open ChromaRunner.sln in Visual Studio 2022
# 3. Build Solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)

# Option 3: Build via Unreal Editor
# 1. Double-click SideRunner.uproject
# 2. Unreal Editor will auto-compile C++ on first launch (may take 5-10 minutes)
```

### Run the Game

```bash
# From Unreal Editor
# Click "Play" (Alt+P) in the editor toolbar

# Standalone build (after compilation)
./Binaries/Linux/SideRunner
# or on Windows:
Binaries\Win64\SideRunner.exe
```

## 🎯 How to Play

**Controls:**
- **Spacebar / W**: Jump (press twice for double-jump)
- **A / D**: Move left/right *(limited horizontal movement)*
- **ESC**: Pause menu
- **`** *(tilde)*: Debug console *(development builds only)*

**Objective:** Survive as long as possible, collect coins, reach 5,000 meters to win!

**Lives System:** You start with 3 lives. Each death costs 1 life. Lose all 3 lives = Game Over.

**Obstacles:**
- 🔪 **Spikes**: Instant damage (15 HP)
- 🧱 **Walls**: Block your path
- 👾 **Enemies**: Moving hazards *(coming soon)*

**Debug Commands** *(Development builds only)*:
```
TeleportToDistance 5000    # Teleport to 5000m (test win condition)
KillPlayer                  # Instant death (test lives system)
stat fps                    # Show FPS counter
```

## 🛠️ Core Systems

### 1. Character Movement (`RunnerCharacter`)
- State machine: Idle, Running, Jumping, Falling, DoubleJumping, Dead
- Double-jump mechanic with coyote time
- Side-scrolling movement with limited horizontal control

### 2. Health System (`PlayerHealthComponent`)
- 100 HP maximum health
- Damage types: Spikes, EnemyMelee, Projectile, Environmental
- Invulnerability frames (1 second after damage)
- Death handling with lives integration

### 3. Lives System (`SideRunnerGameInstance`)
- 3 lives per game session
- Death → Respawn with remaining lives
- 0 lives → Game Over screen
- High score persistence across sessions

### 4. Game Flow (`SideRunnerGameMode`)
- Widget lifecycle management (HUD, Game Over screens)
- Delegate-driven architecture (OnGameWon, OnGameLost events)
- Input mode switching (gameplay ↔ UI)
- Prevents duplicate game over screens

### 5. UI System (UMG C++)
- **GameHUDWidget**: Lives, distance, score display
- **GameOverWidget**: Win/loss screens with restart functionality
- Event-driven updates (no Tick overhead for performance)

### 6. Procedural Levels (`BaseLevel`)
- Trigger-based segment spawning
- Difficulty scaling over distance
- Object pooling for performance
- Activatable/deactivatable segments

## 🐛 Known Issues

- **Performance**: FPS drops on older GPUs with 4+ active levels (workaround: reduce `MaxActiveLevels` in config)
- **Linux Build**: Requires `clang-15` or newer (Ubuntu 22.04+ recommended)
- **WSL 2**: Graphics acceleration required for Unreal Editor

See [Issues](https://github.com/[YourUsername]/ChromaRunner/issues) for full list and workarounds.
