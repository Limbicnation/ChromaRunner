feat(wallspike): Complete WallSpike system with Y-axis movement, collision detection, and enhanced audio

MAJOR FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
? Fixed WallSpike direction from X-axis to Y-axis (Forward) movement by default  
? Added Blueprint-exposed directional controls with 6 preset directions
? Implemented multi-layered collision detection system for reliable player death
? Enhanced audio system with chase sounds and dramatic death effects
? Fixed critical syntax errors and compilation issues

COLLISION DETECTION IMPROVEMENTS:
- Multiple collision detection layers: SetActorLocation sweep, OnOverlapBegin, OnHit, NotifyHit, Proximity detection
- Enhanced collision setup with proper mobility settings (Movable components)  
- Bulletproof collision system with 200-unit proximity sphere trace as backup
- Added comprehensive collision debug logging for troubleshooting

DIRECTIONAL SYSTEM OVERHAUL:
- Changed default movement from Right (+X) to Forward (+Y) direction
- Added integer-based preset direction system (0-5) for Blueprint compatibility  
- Directional options: Forward(+Y), Backward(-Y), Right(+X), Left(-X), Up(+Z), Down(-Z)
- Maintained custom direction vector support for advanced use cases
- Fixed enum naming conflicts with Unreal Engine built-in functions

AUDIO SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS:
- Inherited CollisionSound from base Spikes class for death sound effect
- Added ChaseStartSound for when WallSpike locks onto player target
- Added ChaseLoopSound for continuous audio feedback during pursuit  
- Implemented UAudioComponent for proper looping sound management
- Enhanced death sound with 50% volume boost and lower pitch for drama
- Smart audio management: starts/stops sounds based on chase state

TECHNICAL FIXES:
- Fixed 'Found EOF when expecting semicolon' error by adding missing class closing brace
- Resolved FVector_NetQuantize type conversion issues in collision detection
- Added proper include for Components/AudioComponent.h  
- Fixed enum declaration conflicts by using integer-based system instead
- Improved code organization with clear function separation

BLUEPRINT INTEGRATION:
- All directional controls exposed to Blueprint designers
- Volume and pitch multipliers for chase sounds configurable in Blueprint
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing WallSpike implementations
- Clear property categories: 'Movement Direction', 'WallSpike Audio', 'Chasing'

DEBUGGING & MAINTENANCE:  
- Comprehensive debug logging throughout chase and collision systems
- Visual debug lines for movement direction, chase range, and target tracking
- Instance-based cleanup timers to prevent memory leaks
- Robust error handling for null pointers and invalid states

This commit represents a complete overhaul of the WallSpike system, transforming it from a buggy X-axis moving hazard into a sophisticated Y-axis chasing threat with reliable collision detection and immersive audio feedback.
